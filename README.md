# Overview

This is the backend server for the [Autocomplete Code Challenge](https://github.com/toptive/autocomplete-sandbox-frontend).

## Purpose

The idea is not to make everything from scratch since we know that might take a while to sort everything out, that's why this repository contains most of the building blocks to get you started quickly.

- You should aim for using the less amount of code as possible.
- You should implement the `google#findAddress` in the most efficient way.
- Beat 600ms execution time as logged on the server, is a plus.
